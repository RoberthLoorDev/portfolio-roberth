  This project focused on developing a <strong class="focus">card collection management system</strong> for streamer d0oppa's community. <br/><br/>
  The streamer needed a frontend interface to complement his existing backend, aiming to create an engaging system for managing trading cards with his community.

  The development concentrated on creating an <strong class="focus">attractive user experience</strong> that would revitalize community participation.
  <br/><br/>
  Key implemented functionalities include:
  <br/><br/>
  <strong>User Management:</strong> A comprehensive system to display users and their collections, including detailed tracking of card ownership.
  <br/><br/>
  <strong>Card Interface:</strong> An attractive visualization system for available cards and user collections, ensuring an engaging display of content.
  <br/><br/>
  <strong>Ranking System:</strong> Implementation of a top users system based on card collection quantities, promoting healthy competition.
  <br/><br/>
  <strong>Responsive Design:</strong> A fully adaptive interface ensuring optimal experience across all devices.
  <br/><br/>
  <strong>Backend Integration:</strong> Efficient connection with the streamer's existing API system.

  The system was developed with <strong class="focus">modern technologies</strong> such as React with Next.js, TypeScript for robust development, and Tailwind CSS for responsive design. The platform was deployed on Vercel for optimal performance.
  <br/><br/>
  Currently, there are some issues with the backend provided by the client. Communication attempts have been made to resolve these problems, but no response has been received to implement the necessary fixes.
