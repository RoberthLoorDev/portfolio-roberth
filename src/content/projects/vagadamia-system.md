body: |-
  This ongoing project delivers a <strong class="focus">comprehensive management platform</strong> for VAGADAMIA, a nationwide hardware supplier. It replaces a legacy PHP system and streamlines daily operations across orders, inventory, and services.

  The system covers: <br/><br/> <strong>Purchase Orders & Invoicing:</strong> Create and track purchase orders with automatic state transitions. Invoicing records are registered and linked to orders to keep financial traces consistent. <br/><br/> <strong>Service Orders & Maintenance Scheduling:</strong> Plan maintenance with clarity: next visit, location, number of devices, what follows, plus views for the <em>current</em> and <em>next</em> month. Notifications alert users about upcoming work. <br/><br/> <strong>Serial Numbers & Warehouse Inventory:</strong> Manage individual devices by serial number, monitor warehouse stock and status, and associate units to purchase orders—or mark them as available inventory. <br/><br/> <strong>Documents & PDF Generation:</strong> One-click batch export for <em>delivery records</em>, <em>technical warranties</em>, <em>technology currency warranties</em>, <em>maintenance schedules</em>, and <em>original-equipment certificates</em>. What used to mean manually producing tens of PDFs now takes a single action. <br/><br/> <strong>Dashboards, Cards & Notifications:</strong> Clean dashboards show key metrics and statuses at a glance, while targeted notifications keep teams ahead of deadlines. <br/><br/> <strong>Public Procurement Watcher (Web Scraping):</strong> Automatically checks government procurement portals for <strong class="focus">new orders</strong> and surfaces them for quick registration—solving the previous blind spot in early detection. <br/><br/> <strong>Roles & Permissions:</strong> Granular access rules define who can create, edit, or delete data across modules, improving security and governance.

  Built with <strong class="focus">React</strong> on the frontend, <strong class="focus">TypeScript</strong> throughout, and an <strong class="focus">Express</strong> backend using <strong class="focus">Sequelize</strong>. UI is implemented with <strong class="focus">Tailwind CSS</strong> and <strong class="focus">shadcn/ui</strong>. The architecture emphasizes maintainability, clear workflows, and automation to reduce repetitive work.
