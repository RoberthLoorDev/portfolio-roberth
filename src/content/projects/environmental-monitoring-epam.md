achievements:
  - '<strong>Significant social impact:</strong>  Besides directly benefiting laboratories, the system indirectly improved service quality for the <strong class="focus">258,000 people</strong> depending on EPAM.'

  - '<strong>Cost reduction:</strong>  Implementation of an economical system that <strong class="focus">automated monitoring </strong> in three key laboratories (Reagents, General, and Microbiology).'

  - '<strong>Advanced interface:</strong> Graphs were designed <strong class="focus">in the mobile app,</strong>  offering detailed summaries of room status, average data, maximums, minimums, and alert logs.'

  - ' <strong>Alerts and customization:</strong>  Configurable alert limits, visual notifications in the app and LED screens, <strong class="focus">and real-time critical alerts.</strong> '

  - ' <strong>Advanced queries:</strong> Features to query historical data in specific hourly ranges, with access to <strong class="focus">daily summaries </strong> and room status.'

  - ' <strong>Guaranteed scalability:</strong>  The system was <strong class="focus">designed to support</strong>  new laboratories or rooms, ensuring its viability for future requirements.'


conclusion: 'This project not only demonstrated its technical efficacy but also its capacity to provide scalable and sustainable solutions to real problems, standing out as an essential tool for environmental monitoring at EPAM.'


body: |
  The project consisted of the design and implementation of an <strong class="focus">IoT system for real-time monitoring</strong>  of temperature and humidity in the laboratories of the Empresa PÃºblica de Agua de Manta (EPAM). <br/> <br/> The initiative was developed under the <strong class="focus">Extreme Programming (XP) methodology,</strong>  selected for its adaptability to small teams and encouragement of rapid iterations.

  During development, weekly meetings were held with executives, ensuring constant alignment with the client's objectives and requirements.
  <br/><br/>

  The system integrated <strong class="focus">hardware and software,</strong>  using DHT22 sensors connected to ESP32 microcontrollers for environmental data capture, which was transmitted through an Express backend and stored in MongoDB Atlas. The data was presented in a <strong class="focus">web application developed</strong>  with React, <strong class="focus">a mobile app</strong>  in React Native, and LED screens in the laboratories for local real-time visualization. Additionally, notifications were implemented via <strong class="focus">Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)</strong>  for critical alerts, optimizing the control of environmental conditions.
